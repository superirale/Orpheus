# TODO

- [ ] Zone Shapes	Replace simple spheres with boxes or polygons for more precise triggers.
- [ ] Crossfading	When multiple zones overlap, normalize total volume or prioritize one zone.
- [ ] Reverb / DSP Filters	Add SoLoud filters to simulate room reverb per zone.
- [ ] Occlusion	Apply lowpass filters when obstacles block line of sight.
- [ ] Dynamic Zones	Move or scale zones during gameplay (e.g., vehicle interiors).

- [ ] Occlusion/obstruction (line-of-sight checks)
- [ ] Per-sound DSP chains
- [ ] Convolution reverb (impulse response based)
- [ ] Ray-traced acoustics
